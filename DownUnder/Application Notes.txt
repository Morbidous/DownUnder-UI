A cross-platform Windows.Forms alternative built for the video game library MonoGame.

Implementing the experience and simplicity of a Visual GUI 
editor with the graphical control of a game library, the Downunder.UI library
implements:

- Simple and straightforward multi-threaded multi-window functionality.
- CS code generation and direct communication with Visual Studio.
- A Modular and serializable Widget system with user defined snapping
  and resizing policies.
- Push buttons, grids, combo boxes and more designed with the goal of 
  implementing all common GUI controls while improving the experience implementing 
  them.
- A clean, sheek and universially stylistic default skin with varied subtle animations.

As an alternative to XML serialization, all Widgets and Widget layouts serialize 
directly to C# code that generates the object. (See DownUnder.Utilities.Serialization.CSCreator)
This allows for significantly improved responsiveness compared to the norm of forms 
using interpreted serialization.
