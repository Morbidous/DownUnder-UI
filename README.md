# DownUnder UI
A UI library built with .NET Core and MonoGame 3.8. Compatible with all platforms MonoGame supports; Android, iOS, Windows, and more.

Closer to usable than not, but still in development.

## Features
 - Familiar functionality and workflow with Windows Forms and Qt.
 - Built from the ground up with modern transitions, animations, and shaders in mind.
 - [Modular behavior system](https://github.com/jamieyello/DownUnder-UI/wiki/Using-the-Library:-Part-3,-Creating-WidgetBehaviors) that can add any functionality.

## Documentation/How to Use
This project is a shared project library, meaning it does not compile without your project. An Azure DevOps package will be put up, but until then it can be added as a shared project reference directly.

Note that the daily commits often times break things. Stable builds will be posted soon.

And read the [getting started guide.](https://github.com/jamieyello/DownUnder-UI/wiki/Using-the-Library:-Part-1,-Setting-Up)
