# DownUnder UI
An ambitious UI library built with .NET and MonoGame. Currently builds for Windows, platforms such as mobile, console, browser, and game engines like Unity and Unreal are planned.

To compile you'll need a recent version of MonoGame and the latest .NET SDKs installed.

Still an early WIP. Testing and feedback needed!

## Features
 - Familiar functionality and workflow with Windows Forms and Qt.
 - Built from the ground up with modern transitions, animations, and shaders in mind.
 - [Modular behavior system](https://github.com/jamieyello/DownUnder-UI/wiki/UI.Widget) that can add any functionality.

## Planned Features
 - Multi-window support.
 - Community marketplace to share Widgets and Widget behaviors.

## Preview Build
The preview build showcases Widget transitions and animations in an unfinished Widget editor. The entirety of the window is made of Widgets, all functionality added through WidgetBehaviors, and can be serialized to XML and back with the same functionality.

> The bar on the right contains the working behaviors and Widgets of the editor. Click the "+ New Widget" button to add a new Widget in the editor, drag the new Widget onto the project on the left to add a Widget to the project. Click the "+ New Widget" button multiple times to showcase spacing and animation properties.
