# DownUnder UI
A UI library built with .NET Core and MonoGame 3.8. Compatible with all platforms MonoGame supports; Android, iOS, Windows, and more.

Closer to usable than not, but still in development.

## Features
 - Familiar functionality and workflow with Windows Forms and Qt.
 - Built from the ground up with modern transitions, animations, and shaders in mind.
 - [Modular behavior system](https://github.com/jamieyello/DownUnder-UI/wiki/Native-WidgetBehaviors) that can add any functionality.
